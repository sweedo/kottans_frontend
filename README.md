  I've heard about **Git** and **GitHub** before I started learning them for Kottans courses, but I couldn't even imagine how much easier they making collaboration between programmers.

  **Git** is like big powerfull instrument for project's creation as for single programmers as like a projects with many contributors. It's helps keep your project in clear historical structure and having a back ups for each important or danger change in your code. Also **Git** lets you make a lot experiments in your project using branches.

  **GitHub** is like sotial network for programmers where thay can share expiriense and projects. Also it's enables to create big open source projects with hundreds contributors. Moreover **GitHub** let you work with your code from different devices and provides cloud back up.
